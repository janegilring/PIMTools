# Deprecation

This module was deprecated in 2025 due to the need to update the API calls to newer ones.
Since a lot of alternative tools (both CLI and PowerShell) exists, it was decided to deprecate this module.


# PIMTools

PIMTools is a PowerShell module with commands for working with Azure AD Privileged Identity Management.

See [this](https://www.powershell.no/azure,/powershell,/pim,/privileged/identity/management,/azure/ad/2020/10/10/pim-tools.html) blog-post for more information.

# Getting started

1. **Start Windows PowerShell**

Press the Start button and search for "PowerShell". You will likely get two hits:
"Windows PowerShell" and "Windows PowerShell ISE". For more modern console and editor features you may also want to check out [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Allow PowerShell scripts to be executed**

PowerShell has a feature called "execution policy" which by default is set to "Restricted",
meaning that no scripts is allowed to run. In the context of this article, I will recommend
to set the execution policy to "RemoteSigned". This means that you can run scripts locally
without having to sign it with a digital signature.

```powershell
# Check current settings
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# If the execution policy is set to Restricted, run the following command to configure the execution policy to RemoteSigned
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

# Make sure you start PowerShell with "Run As Administrator" before running the command. Alternatively, run the following if you do not have Administrator privileges:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

3. **Install the PIMTools module**

The module is available from the PowerShell Gallery, meaning we can install it by simply running the following:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name PIMTools
```

If this is the first time you run this command, you will be prompted to install NuGet which is being
 used under the hood to interact with the PowerShell Gallery. Answer *Yes* when prompted to install
this prerequisite. Next, you will be warned that the PowerShell Gallery by default is configured
as an untrusted source. Answer *Yes* to acknowledge this and install the module.

Now the module is installed and is ready to be used.

After you have installed the module, you can later on run the following to get any new version which may contain bug fixes and new functionality:
```powershell
Update-Module -Name PIMTools
```

4. **Example usage**

```powershell
# Elevate an eligble Azure AD role
New-AzureADPIMRequest -RoleName 'Global Administrator'

# Elevate an eligble Azure role
New-AzurePIMRequest -RoleName Owner -ResourceName IT -ResourceType ManagementGroup

New-AzurePIMRequest -RoleName Contributor -ResourceName MySubscription -ResourceType Subscription
```
